# Data Validation

## Input Validation

**Id:** Oak9.Req.DV.1

**Sub category:** Input Validation

**Description:** Ensure that the application only accepts valid inputs and any malformed or malicious inputs are rejected

**Elaboration:** Input validation should be applied on both syntactical and Semantic level. Syntactic validation should enforce correct syntax of structured fields (e.g. SSN, date, currency symbol). Semantic validation should enforce correctness of their values in the specific business context (e.g. start date is before end date, price is within expected range). It is always recommended to prevent attacks as early as possible in the processing of the user's (attacker's) request. Input validation can be used to detect unauthorized input before it is processed by the application.
